CV Themes:
----------

The repository conatins many CV Themes (Will hopefully add more). Presently the following themes are present,
-	cvLight : Uses default latex fonts. Thus, needs only latex to compile. Less focus on emphasis, so those who desire more contrast in text (or need of highlighting) should avoid this.
-	cvNorm : The structure is borrowed from cvLight, but the fonts have been modified (completely). The required fonts are given alongside. The template used for some parts is borrowed form the awesome resume template from [Deedy (Which was further modified by Vel)](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/deedy-resume-cv). Require XeLatex or LuaLatex compilers.

The sample resume formed by using this theme can seen in [My Resume] (https://nishantrai18.github.io/resources/cvCompact.pdf).
